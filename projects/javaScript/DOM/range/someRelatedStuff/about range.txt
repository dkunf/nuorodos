  <!-- actually range slider is needed when 
      you want to see quickly results of using some very different values.
       And maybe you don't care what values are, but interested in effect only.

    Entering from keyboard takes more efforts and time (esp if you need to press ENTER each time),
    unless it's arrows(with keypress events), but arrows can change range insignifficantly
    while slider can be moved very significantly.

    Maybe 2d range is best for picking colors, right?
    because it's very visual and very quick to choose what you want.
    Imagine doing this with #ee7722 or rgb notation from keyboard! 
      
    so to make sense using range slider:
    1: range changes are significant (otherwise arrow keys)
    2: you need to visualize effect of changing values quickly
    3. you don't care of values themselves most of times like #336699

    Ideas:
-   what if i use it applying a lot of css styles to some group 
    of elements and seeing effect of doing it immediately?????
    for example margin,padding,height,width.
    then flex with all flex options 
    then grid with all grid options 
    and i don't need to know which ones applied until i find suittable one :)
    same with colors, shaddows, animation params etc.....
    border-radii are tricky, gradients

-   graph plot ranges and zoom levels when analizing curves
